  <h2>M3nny's website</h2>
</div>

Here you can find some of my projects and the ideas behind them.

This site has been done thanks to the [urara](https://urara-docs.netlify.app/) template, which uses:

- [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as the app framework
- [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) as the markdown preprocessor
- [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/) for the themes

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M3nny/website && cd website
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
