## Assignment
This was a group project on my last year of high school, where the assignment was to develop a mobile app. <br>
We decided to use [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) since it is a quite new technology, and also we never used dart so it could've been an interesting experience.

### The idea ðŸ’¡
I have to give credit to a friend of mine who, being a scout, suggested that a morse translator might have been useful.

### Development
We did not want it to be just a simple written translation, so we added three additional visualisation methods:
- **light**: the phone torch is used and the blink duration is determined by the morse character (-/.)
- **vibrations**: the phone emmits longer (-) or shorter (.) vibrations
- **sound**: we used two sounds, one longer for the dashes (-) and one shorter for the dots (.)
