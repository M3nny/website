## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As of the time of writing i'm a <u>computer science</u> student [@unive](https://www.unive.it/) <br>
my coding experiences in general range from back-end to front-end, but the thing I love the most is trying out new stuff to expand my toolkit.

### Interests
If you don't find me running after my cats or watching a tv series, you will find me working on some open source project.

Over the years I have done and am still doing personal projects, the best of which can be found on this site.
