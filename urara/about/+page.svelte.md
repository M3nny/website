## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As of the time of writing i'm a <u>computer science</u> student [@unive](https://www.unive.it/), <br>
my coding experiences in general range from back-end to front-end, but the thing I love the most is trying out new stuff to expand my toolkit.

### Hobbies
If you don't find me completing _zelda totk_, you will find me working on some open source project. <br>
I am a member of the awesome [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) community, creator of the [vim](https://github.com/catppuccin/vim) theme port, but besides that I have done other personal projects, the best of which can be found on this site.
